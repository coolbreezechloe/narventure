Constants
---------

* Scope can be global
* Use `const` keyword, it is not the same as an immutable variable
* Naming Conventions. Typically all upper case with underscores for spaces
* Not mutable
* Must be annotated
* Must be set to a constant expression, can not be the result of a function

Shadowing
---------

* A new variable with same name as a perviously defined variable
* Rustaceans say the first variable is shadowed by the second
* <example>
* can change the type
* with let we can perform a few changes on a variable without having it
  by mutable at the end
